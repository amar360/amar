BlueSource
BlueSource is Wellmark's Enrollment platform for Small Group, Large Group, and Individual insurance plans.

Data Flow
BlueSource Data Flow
BlueSource Data Flow
BlueSource gets data to display current group demographics, and rates. It also creates enrollment data for Facets, documents for Kovis, and communications sent to members. This briefly describes the many different ways that input and output is created by and for BlueSource.

Networking
The Bluesource UI resides in AWS and it calls the BlueSource Audience Service API.  The BlueSource Audience Service API calls other enterprise APIs that sit on top of the SRDB.AWS.Wellmark.com Database and access data that way.

Batch Processing
Batch Name	Description	Day & Time Batch is Run	Logs
Renewals - "sales-renew-get-renewals"	The renewals job is a 2 part process. The get-renewals batch job picks up any small groups in facets that are renewing within the next 90 days, and checks if a renewal has been generated for that group within the previous 90 days. If one hasn't been generated yet, it drops a file for each groupId into an s3 bucket. Each placement of a file into that s3 bucket triggers a lambda to be run on it.	Daily at midnight. Almost all renewals are picked up on the 1st of the month. Job runs daily in case there are changes or retries.	ALM Cloud Watch - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logStream:group=/aws/lambda/sales-renew-get-renewals
Renewals = "sales-renew-process-renewals"	This is a lambda that pops off files 1 at a time in the s3 bucket referenced above and generates a renewal for each record. At the end, we write complete or failed for each record in the Event.BatchRenewalEvent table.	not scheduled, but runs 3 processes at a time when the above job drops files to the s3.	
ALM Cloud Watch - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logStream:group=/aws/lambda/sales-renew-process-renewals
Submit Passive Renewals "sales-renew-release-pended"	Similar process to the renewal. On the night of the 20th, this job picks up any renewal that hasn't been submitted by the agent and "Submits" it to bluesource. These are then reviewed and released by Ops team.	monthly on the 20th at 8pm.

Submit Passive Renewals "sales-renew-release-pended-helper"	This is a lambda that pops off files 1 at a time in the s3 bucket referenced above and submits the renewal for each item.	not scheduled, but runs 1 process at a time when the above job drops files to the s3	ALM Cloud Watch - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logStream:group=/aws/lambda/sales-renew-release-pended-helper
Reference Data	ETL process by DM that loads reference data from <where> to srdb		ALM Cloud Watch
Sales-Renew-Facets-Batch-Retry	Re submits transactions with pended status of "Facets Batch Pend". Also, sends a follow-up email that says how many successful renewals were generated on the previous night.	Daily 8a.m.	ALM Cloud Watch - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logStream:group=/aws/lambda/sales-renew-facets-batch-retry
Binder Batch / Retry Batch	Binder Batch and Retry Batch: Runs every weekday (M-F)
Binder Batch is primarily for the Exchange processing of Empire requests sent to BlueSource with a Binderflg = Y

Retry Batch is for failed events within the event.event table on SRDB.

Binder Batch: 5:45 p.m.
Retry: 12-1 p.m.

Enrollment Q&A
BlueSource is able to be dynamic by updating a table in the Consumer database called QuestionAnswer. Each type of business that you are working on (renewals, enrollment, manage business) could have a variation on the fields needed to make the UI meaningful

Below is a summary of these results

Troubleshooting
Issue Summary	What it is	How to fix	Diagnosis notes
Dynatrace Response time for API's jumps up in 2 second intervals	DNS issue	Restart DNS Server	I also just made a few GET requests against production and saw the same request sometimes returning in 90ms and sometimes returning in 8s.  The DNS server has a 2 second timeout on it, so we start to see apis resonding with 2/4/6/8/etc seconds fairly consistently.
Data Released from BlueSource did not get to Facets as expected	Data, API, or Facets issue?		Check SRDB to see if there is a release to Facets, Check the API's with Dyanatrace to see that there is no error at this time, or Check Mongo to review the data sent to WFA (Wellmark Facets API)
When a group goes through an AOR creating a date break in Facets, Renewal is pulling in the Internal Agent instead of the External Agent so the External Agent is not able to access their renewals.	AOR incorrect	Update AOR with DB Script	Update the script for the Producer key and Consumer key
the query gets the consumer key and then the producer key which you then give a query to the db admin to run that updates the db

we would only send something like this

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;

Update Producer.ProducerConsumerRel

set ProducerKey = 12345

where ConsumerKey = 12345;

Integrations
DocuSign
BlueSource will send DocuSign a document for an external user to digitally sign. When the signature is complete, we expect DocuSign to call a BlueSource API to send the document back, and create an event in SRDB

Facets
BlueSource submits data to Facets with the Wellmark Facets API (WFA). Review data sent to Facets with the Mongo database. BlueSource will retreive data from Facets, especially in the Manage Business screen and Renewal Regeneration.

Data from facets populates the Manage Business module, sourced from the Integrated Data Hub (IDH) batch job
